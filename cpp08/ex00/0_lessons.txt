LESSONS:

Think of a container as a data structure that stores a collection of elements.
The C++ Standard Library (STL) gives you many ready-made containers:

std::vector<int> → dynamic array (like an int[] that can grow/shrink).
std::list<int> → doubly linked list.
std::deque<int> → double-ended queue.
std::set<int> → sorted unique elements.
std::map<Key, Value> → dictionary / associative array.

but how do we look inside these containers?
Every STL container provides iterators: objects that act like pointers to the elements inside.

container.begin() → iterator pointing to the first element.
container.end() → iterator pointing just past the last element.

👉 You move an iterator forward using it++, and you access the value with *it.
