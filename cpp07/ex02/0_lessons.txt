LESSONS:

For a class, you need to overload the subscript operator [] for your Array class 
because it is not a built-in feature for custom classes. 
The operator is only natively available for C-style arrays (int arr[10];).

Overloading the operator allows you to define its behavior for your class, making 
it possible to access elements using the familiar myArray[index] syntax. 
This improves the usability and readability of your Array class, 
making it behave similarly to a built-in array while also allowing 
you to add custom logic, such as bounds checking.

Without overloading [], a call like myArray[0] would be a compiler error. 
Overloading it lets you control what happens when that syntax is used.
